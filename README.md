# PythonCalculator 🚀

**Welcome to my very first Python project!** This is a desktop application built with Python and the PySide6 GUI library.

**Note:** ⚠️ This project is actively under development. I'm learning and building it step-by-step!





## ✨ Features

Here are some of the things **PythonCalculator** can (already!) do:

* Handles basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
* Supports scientific functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, `√`)
* Includes a built-in solver for linear equations (e.g., `5*x + 3 = 10`)
* Undo/Redo functionality (`↶`, `↷`)
* Settings menu (Dark Mode, decimal places, etc.)
* Custom error handling and dedicated error codes

## 🚀 How to Use

Currently, the easiest way to test this application is by using the `.exe` file I'm building for friends and testers.

(Later, you can add a link here if you upload the `.exe` to GitHub "Releases".)

## 🐞 Found a Bug?

Awesome! Since this is my first project, I'm still learning. If you find a bug, spot an error, or have an idea for an improvement, I would be thrilled to hear about it.

The best way is to **create an "Issue"** right here on GitHub.
